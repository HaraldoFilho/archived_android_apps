If network is disconnected a "-" is shown instead. Also, if available, the location of the network is shown on a map.
<br><br><b>Press for a few seconds</b>
<br>    Opens a menu with four options:

<br>    Connect/disconnect to/from the selected network or cancel the connection operation.

<br>Opens a dialog box where you can change the password of the selected network.
<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Edit description</span>

<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Delete</span>
<br>    Deletes the selected network from the configured networks list of your device.
<br><br><b>NOTE:</b>
<br>Due to changes on the Android API policies, for Android 6.x and higher it will only be possible to delete networks that was added by the same application. If you added the network using another application or direct from the system settings you will not be able to delete it. If you want to manage all networks on WiFi Authority you can delete <b>all</b> networks using the <b><i>Reset network configurations</i></b> option in system settings and you will have the option to restore them the next time the application is opened. All info about the network will be restored, except the password when the network was added outside the application, from system settings or the<i> <b>Store password</b></i> option in application settings is disabled.
